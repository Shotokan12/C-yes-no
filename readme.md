Project Name:
Yes/No really project.

Project Description:
When a person is trying to exit the program they have to answer yes or no. If they answer yes then it repeats it self adding really into the sentence.

Project Explanation:

The user is asked a question.
:Would you like to continue this program?

If the user answers yes, then they are asked the same question again but with the word really imbedded into the sentence.
:Would you like to continue this Program?
::Yes
:Would you really like to continue this Program?

Every time the user answers yes the word really is added. But is multiplied by the number of times they say yes.
Example 
They said yes 3 times
:would you really really really like to continue this Program?
